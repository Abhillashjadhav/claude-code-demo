## Feature: Task Echo API Endpoint

### Problem Statement
Users need a simple, reliable way to verify that their task data is being received correctly by the system. Currently, there is no endpoint to validate that task information can be submitted and acknowledged.

### User Story
**As a** system integrator or API consumer
**I want to** submit task information to an endpoint
**So that** I can verify the system receives my data correctly and is responding as expected

### Business Value
- Enables integration testing for external systems
- Provides a foundation for future task management features
- Reduces support burden by allowing users to self-verify their integration
- Creates a clear contract for API communication patterns

### Feature Description
The system will accept task information from users through a web interface. When a user sends their task data, the system will immediately confirm receipt by echoing back what was received. This creates a closed feedback loop that validates both submission and retrieval are working correctly.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Given** a user submits task information
   **When** the submission is successful
   **Then** the system returns the submitted task data in a confirmation response

2. **Given** the user sends valid task data
   **When** the system processes the request
   **Then** the response clearly indicates what was received

3. **Given** the user sends a request
   **When** the response is returned
   **Then** it arrives in a timely manner (within acceptable latency bounds)

### Edge Cases to Consider
1. **Empty Task Data**: What happens when task information is missing or empty?
2. **Special Characters**: How does the system handle task data with special characters, unicode, or emojis?
3. **Large Payloads**: What is the maximum size of task data that can be submitted?
4. **Concurrent Requests**: How does the system behave when multiple users submit tasks simultaneously?
5. **Malformed Requests**: What error messaging appears when the request format is incorrect?
6. **Network Interruption**: How does the system respond to partial or incomplete submissions?

### Test Cases
1. **Happy Path**: Submit valid task data and verify it's returned correctly
2. **Empty Task**: Submit request with empty task value and verify appropriate response
3. **Missing Task Field**: Submit request without required task field and verify error handling
4. **Special Characters**: Submit task containing special characters (quotes, newlines, unicode) and verify proper handling
5. **Large Task**: Submit task data approaching size limits and verify successful processing
6. **Rapid Submission**: Submit multiple tasks in quick succession and verify all are handled correctly
7. **Invalid Format**: Submit non-JSON data and verify clear error response
8. **Boundary Conditions**: Test with minimum and maximum acceptable data sizes

### Success Metrics
- 100% of valid requests receive appropriate responses
- Response time stays under acceptable latency threshold
- Zero data loss or corruption in the echo response
- Clear, actionable error messages for invalid requests
